### Loan Approval Prediction: Using Machine Learning to Streamline Approval

This project is about automating loan decision-making process for financial institutions using machine learning techniques. The goal of the project is to improve the efficiency and consistency of the loan decision process by using technology to assist with loan decisioning.

In today's fast-paced business environment, financial institutions are under pressure to make loan decisions quickly while maintaining a consistent interpretation of loan policy. Automating loan decision-making can help financial institutions meet these demands by providing answers to loan applicants quickly and increasing consistency in underwriting, approval, and documentation.

According to a study by the Boston Consulting Group, automating loan origination can increase efficiency by up to 50% and reduce loan defaults by up to 20%. Additionally, automating loan decision-making can help financial institutions to quickly adapt to changes in their business strategy and environment. <br>
Our analysis showed that certain features such as income, employment length, and credit history have a significant impact on loan approval. This highlights the importance of these factors in the loan decision-making process and the potential for using machine learning to take these factors into account when making loan decisions.



In this project, we used a dataset containing information about past loan applicants and whether their loan was approved or not. We used two machine learning models, k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) and Logistic Regression to predict whether a loan application will be approved or not. The kNN model achieved an accuracy of 85% while the Logistic Regression model achieved an accuracy of 90%. This project demonstrates the potential of using machine learning to improve the loan decision-making process for financial institutions and shows the potential impact it can have on the industry.
